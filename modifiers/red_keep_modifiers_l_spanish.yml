 rk_kl_stench_7_desc: "Though the city will never be free of odor, King’s Landing now smells merely tolerable. Flea Bottom is cleaner, the markets are less foul, and even the Red Keep’s halls no longer carry the reek of the streets below."
 
 rk_sanitation_effort: "Sanitation Effort"
 rk_sanitation_effort_desc: "For a brief time, the streets of King’s Landing have been swept and privies emptied. The worst of the filth has been cleared away, but without lasting works the city will soon fester once more."

 ###ROYAL MINT
 
 rk_seignorage_profits: "Seigniorage Profits"
 rk_seignorage_profits_desc: "By centralising the minting of coinage in King’s Landing, the Iron Throne retains the profit from every weight of bullion struck into coin. Each dragon, stag, and star returns a little less to its bearer, the difference flowing into the royal treasury as rightful gain."
 
 rk_pure_coinage: "Pure Coinage"
 rk_pure_coinage_desc: "The dragons of gold, the stags of silver, and the stars of copper shine bright and true. Each coin is struck to the highest purity, its weight beyond question. Merchants speak of your coinage with reverence, and even the Braavosi cannot deny its worth."

 rk_strong_coinage: "Strong Coinage"
 rk_strong_coinage_desc: "The coin of the realm is trusted across the Seven Kingdoms and beyond the Narrow Sea. Though not flawless, the dragons, stags, and stars bear their weight honestly, and the people take them with confidence."

 rk_common_coinage: "Common Coinage"
 rk_common_coinage_desc: "The mint strikes coin of fair make, neither strong nor weak. The dragons jingle in purses and the stags pass from hand to hand without comment. The smallfolk accept them, though none boast of their quality."

 rk_debased_coinage: "Debased Coinage"
 rk_debased_coinage_desc: "Whispers spread in markets and counting houses: the king’s dragons are thin, the stags clipped, the stars lighter than they ought be. Trust wanes, and merchants demand more to part with their goods. The coffers swell quickly, but the realm’s faith in its coin is crumbling."

 rk_worthless_coinage: "Worthless Coinage"
 rk_worthless_coinage_desc: "Once proud dragons now trade like brass trinkets, their shine revealing only fraud. The markets shun your coin, and even the smallfolk hoard old pieces rather than accept new. To spend the king’s money is to invite laughter, for all know it is false."
 
 rk_debased_county_modifier: "Debased Coinage"
 rk_debased_county_modifier_desc: "The inhabitants of King's Landing have noticed the lower quality of recently issued coin."

 rk_tariff_timber_furs: "Tariffs on Timber and Furs"
 rk_tariff_timber_furs_desc: "Northern furs and timber pay heavier tolls, sending coin to King’s Landing but souring trade from White Harbor and beyond."

 rk_tariff_essos_imports: "Tariffs on Essossi Imports"
 rk_tariff_essos_imports_desc: "Silks, spices, and luxuries from the Free Cities now pass through the ports at a dearer price, to the enrichment of the Crown and the vexation of foreign merchants."
