#A Royal Ride: The Edge of the World
 rk_go_for_ride.0001.t: "A Royal Ride: The Edge of the World"
 rk_go_for_ride.0001.desc: "This morning, I took to the saddle with no fixed destination—only the need to escape the crush of court and the bitter taste of iron in my mouth. I rode with just a few guards at my back, far enough behind to pretend I was alone.\n\nThe road led me to the cliffs south of Duskendale, where the sea meets the sky in a blur of wind and foam. I dismounted, drawn to the edge, and stood there for some time—watching the endless rise and crash of waves far below.\n\nThe wind roared like a beast. The gulls cried overhead. For a moment, I felt smaller than a squire and greater than a king all at once. There was no court here. No crown. Just sky and stone and something vast."
 rk_go_for_ride.0001.a: "This world is mine, and I shall not falter."
 rk_go_for_ride.0001.a_tt: "You return to court with new resolve."
 rk_go_for_ride.0001.b: "If I vanished here... would they even understand why?"

#A Royal Ride: The Gallop 
 rk_go_for_ride.0002.t: "A Royal Ride: The Gallop"
 rk_go_for_ride.0002.desc: "I left the Red Keep behind this morning with only a few companions, determined to escape the stifling halls and whispered intrigues. The road south was clear, and the air tasted of sunlight and dust.\n\nBy midday, we reached a clearing—vast, green, and rolling to the horizon. I slowed, the others falling back as I took in the open space. It called to something deep in me.\n\nWith a sharp tug of the reins and a grin I couldn’t stop, I kicked my heels, and the horse surged forward. Wind tore at my cloak, hooves thundered beneath me, and for a breathless moment, I was no ruler—just motion and freedom."
 rk_go_for_ride.0002.a: "Faster boy, faster!"
 rk_go_for_ride.0002.a_tt: "You push your horse to its maximum."

#A Royal Ride: A Doll in the Woods
 rk_go_for_ride.0003.t: "A Royal Ride: A Doll in the Woods"
 rk_go_for_ride.0003.desc: "You rode deeper into the woods than intended, the path lost to shadow and silence. Your men were far behind.\n\nThen you saw a lone child. Crying alone among the trees. Her dress was torn, her face dirty, a ragged doll clutched to her chest.\n\nYou called out. She didn’t move.\n\nAs you approached, dread settled in. The doll’s face...\n\nIt wore a crooked crown. The nose, the eyes, the grim mouth — it looked like you."
 rk_go_for_ride.0003.a: "I need to get out of here!"
 rk_go_for_ride.0003.a_tt: "You leave the girl behind."
 rk_go_for_ride.0003.a_f: "The dolls face lingers in your mind."
 rk_go_for_ride.0003.b: "You will be safe at court."
 rk_go_for_ride.0003.b_tt: "You bring the child back to King’s Landing. The child seems relieved."
 rk_go_for_ride.0003.c: "Just another filthy peasant."
 rk_go_for_ride.0003.c_tt: "You pretend you saw nothing and ride past her."  
 rk_go_for_ride.0003.a_toast: "You bring [rk_lost_girl.GetTitledFirstName] to court."

 rk_go_for_ride.0004.t: "A Royal Ride: A Little Secret"
 rk_go_for_ride.0004.desc: "It begins with whispers — strange symbols drawn in ash, herbs vanishing from the maester’s stores, and eerie murmurs in empty halls.\n\n[rk_lost_girl.GetFirstName], the girl you rescued from the woods, has grown quiet and curious. One night, a servant swears they saw her chanting by candlelight, the air thick with incense.\n\nAt first you doubted it. But when you confront her, she doesn't deny it.\n\n"It's just my powers, Your Grace." she says calmly. "But don't worry I would never use them against you. You saved me.""
 rk_go_for_ride.0004.a: "This will be our little secret."
 rk_go_for_ride.0004.a_tt: "You trust in [rk_lost_girl.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 rk_go_for_ride.0004.b: "You will rot in a cell witch!"

 #A Royal Ride: The Voice of the Road 
 rk_go_for_ride.0005.t: "A Royal Ride: The Voice of the Road"
 rk_go_for_ride.0005.desc: "The day had grown quiet as you rode. No banners, no horn calls — just the rhythmic sound of hooves on packed earth and the distant cry of gulls drifting inland from Blackwater Bay.\n\nThen came the voice. It floated on the wind — steady, mournful, and clear as glass. A song, sung accompanied by a lute, rising from the bend ahead in the road.\n\nYou approached slowly and saw the man: a lone troubadour walking with dust on his boots and a waterskin at his side. His voice was beautiful — aching and full of memory. When he noticed you, he stopped and dipped his head. “Your Grace,” he said softly. “Forgive me. I did not hear you ride up.”"
 rk_go_for_ride.0005.a: "Sing in my name."
 rk_go_for_ride.0005.a_tt: "You offer coin and command the troubadour to go out and sign your name across the land."
 rk_go_for_ride.0005.a_toast: "Your name spreads through the land."
 rk_go_for_ride.0005.b: "We could use for a voice like that at court."
 rk_go_for_ride.0005.b_tt: "You invite the troubadour to the Red Keep as a courtier."
 rk_go_for_ride.0005.b_toast: "[rk_troubadour.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] joins you at the Red Keep."
 rk_go_for_ride.0005.c: "Move along. This road is for riders, not singers."
 rk_go_for_ride.0005.c_tt: "You dismiss him without a word more."  

#A Royal Ride: The Shepherd’s Peace
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.t: "A Royal Ride: The Shepherd’s Peace"
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.desc: "The land rolled open ahead of you, green and sun-warmed, the road narrowing into little more than a path through the hills.\n\nUp ahead, a slow-moving flock blocked the way — dozens of sheep shuffling across the trail, bells clinking gently around their necks. A barefoot shepherd, staff in hand, raised a hand in greeting as you approached.\n\nHe didn’t bow, didn’t seem afraid.\n\n“Didn’t think kings rode this far out,” he said mildly. “They say sheep don’t care for crowns. But they do clear a path if you ask nice.”"
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.a: "Move aside!"
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.a_tt: "You push through impatiently, startling the flock."
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.b: "Tell me… what do your kind think of the crown?"
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.b_tt: "You speak with the shepherd and hear his simple truths."
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.b_tt.a: "You learn nothing useful."
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.b_tt.b: "You improve your diplomacy."
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.b_tt.f: "You improve your learning."
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.c: "Here. Something for your trouble."
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.c_tt: "You offer him a gold coin, surprising him."
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.d: "The world can slow down for a moment."
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.d_tt: "You patiently wait for the Sheep to clear the road."   
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.e: "I will have your head!"
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.e_tt: "You strike down the shepherd for his insolence." 
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.f: "Teach me about sheep herding."
 rk_go_for_ride.0006.f_tt: "You spend the afternoon learning about sheep herding."  
 
#A Royal Ride: The Broken Cart
 rk_go_for_ride.0007.t: "A Royal Ride: The Broken Cart"
 rk_go_for_ride.0007.desc: "The morning ride had been smooth — clear skies, dry earth, a steady wind at your back. But rounding a bend, you find the road blocked: a cart overturned, one wheel split clean through.\n\nA peasant strains to lift the axle, sweat on his brow. Beside him, a boy watches you approach, wide-eyed and silent. Their ox lies dead nearby, ribs showing. The cart’s cargo is scattered — sacks, broken tools, a shattered jug.\n\nThe man bows quickly. “Your Grace,” he says, voice trembling. “The wheel gave out… we’ve no coin for repairs. If it please you... a little help?”"
 rk_go_for_ride.0007.a: "My men will fix it."
 rk_go_for_ride.0007.a_tt: "You order your retinue to assist the peasant."
 rk_go_for_ride.0007.b: "Take this and buy a new cart."
 rk_go_for_ride.0007.b_tt: "You give him coin from your personal purse."
 rk_go_for_ride.0007.c: "Out of the way!"
 rk_go_for_ride.0007.c_tt: "You ride past without helping."
 rk_go_for_ride.0007.d: "You’ve slowed the King’s road. That is punishable."
 rk_go_for_ride.0007.d_tt: "You have the man sent to your cells."   

#A Royal Ride: The Unwanted Child
 rk_go_for_ride.0008.t: "A Royal Ride: The Unwanted Child"
 rk_go_for_ride.0008.desc: "You ride through a quiet stretch of countryside when your party slows near an old roadside shrine — a squat stone altar, flanked by wilted flowers and burnt-down candles.\n\nAt its base rests a wicker basket. Inside: a newborn child, bundled in coarse linens. Its head is large, limbs small and crooked, hands clenched like knots of root.\n\nThe infant shifts slightly, lips parting in a soundless breath. One of your guards mutters a curse.\n\n“A dwarf,” he says. “Poor thing. Folk say it’s a punishment, or a sign. Hard to raise — harder to wed. Likely why they left it.”\n\nA pair of peasants linger behind the trees, watching but not daring to speak."
 rk_go_for_ride.0008.a: "Leave him. [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] will decide his fate."
 rk_go_for_ride.0008.a_tt: "You turn away, offering no aid."
 rk_go_for_ride.0008.b: "Take the child. He will be raised at court."
 rk_go_for_ride.0008.b_tt: "You bring the child to the Red Keep, under your protection."
 rk_go_for_ride.0008.b_toast: "You take the child with you."
 rk_go_for_ride.0008.c: "Send him to a sept. The Faith may take him in."
 rk_go_for_ride.0008.c_tt: "You arrange for the child to be raised in a religious house."  

#A Royal Ride: The Charred Ground
 rk_go_for_ride.0009.t: "A Royal Ride: The Charred Ground"
 rk_go_for_ride.0009.desc: "The smell of burnt earth strikes you before the sight does. A low, bitter wind rolls across the plain, carrying ash with it.\n\nYour party soon halts at the edge of a wide field, blackened and dead. The soil is cracked and dry, the grass turned to dust, the trees along the border leafless and scorched.\n\nNo farmhouses remain. No bodies. No smoke. Just silence and ruin.\n\nOne of your men kneels and presses a hand to the ground. “Still warm,” he mutters. “But no fire’s been seen from the city, and no lightning struck.”\n\nAnother looks to you with unease. “If you hadn't ridden here yourself, Your Grace, I'd say a dragon passed this way.”"
 rk_go_for_ride.0009.a: "Nonsense. Ride On."
 rk_go_for_ride.0009.a_tt: "You dismiss the strangeness and continue."
 rk_go_for_ride.0009.b: "Scour the land. I want every answer."
 rk_go_for_ride.0009.b_tt: "You order a full investigation of the site."
 rk_go_for_ride.0009.b_n: "Your men fail to find any clues..."
 rk_go_for_ride.0009.c: "My dragon did not do this…"
 rk_go_for_ride.0009.c_tt: "You consider the possibility that another [dragon|E] roams unclaimed."
 rk_go_for_ride.0009.b_n_tt: "Despite interrogating the locals, your men fail to discover the cause of the fire."

#A Royal Ride: The Storm
 rk_go_for_ride.0010.t: "A Royal Ride: The Storm"
 rk_go_for_ride.0010.desc: "I felt it before I saw it — the air thickening, the sharp scent of coming rain.\nThunder cracked in the distance. Then the wind rose, tearing through the trees as the first heavy drops began to fall.\n\nI didn’t wait. I kicked my horse hard and rode, fast and low, the storm chasing at my heels.\n\nBy the time King’s Landing came into view, I was soaked through, cloak heavy with water and heart still pounding."
 rk_go_for_ride.0010.a: "I'm drenched..."
 rk_go_for_ride.0010.a_tt: "You gallop back through the storm, soaked and breathless."  

#A Royal Ride: The Pale Tree
 rk_go_for_ride.0011.t: "A Royal Ride: The Pale Tree"
 rk_go_for_ride.0011.desc: "The Kingswood was quiet — no birdsong, no rustling leaves, just the sound of hooves over dry soil. I had ridden ahead of the others, letting the silence settle around me like a cloak.\nThen I saw it.\nAmong the oaks and elms, stark and still, stood a single weirwood. Pale as bone, smooth as stone. Its red leaves whispered in a breeze I could not feel. The carved face in its trunk watched me — eyes bleeding sap, mouth pulled in a silent grimace.\nThere are no weirwoods in the Kingswood, they say. Not anymore.\n\nAnd yet."
 rk_go_for_ride.0011.a: "Offer a quiet prayer."
 rk_go_for_ride.0011.a_tt: "You murmur a few words to the old gods... just in case."
 rk_go_for_ride.0011.b: "Best to keep riding."
 rk_go_for_ride.0011.b_tt: "You leave the pale tree behind, not daring to look back."
 rk_go_for_ride.0011.c: "Sit a while under its shadow."
 rk_go_for_ride.0011.c_tt: "You sit beneath the weirwood, and something ancient stirs within you."
 rk_go_for_ride.0011.c_b: "Something ancient stirs within you."
 rk_go_for_ride.0011.c_a: "You never felt this close to the gods."
 rk_go_for_ride.0011.d: "Have it cut down."
 rk_go_for_ride.0011.d_tt: "You order your men to mark the tree for felling. The old gods have no place here." 
 rk_go_for_ride.0011.c_toast: "You fail to feel anything."

#A Royal Ride: A Warm Invitation

 rk_go_for_ride.0012.desc: "The ride had taken us near the soft green lands of [rk_inviting_noble.GetTitledFirstName] when a rider approached, mud on his cloak and breath tight in his chest.\n\nHe bowed low before delivering his message: \n\n“Your Grace,” he said, voice steady despite the dust on his cloak, “my liege, [rk_inviting_noble.GetTitledFirstName] humbly requests the honor of your presence at his table this evening. My [rk_inviting_noble.GetLadyLord] would be most honored to host you for supper at [rk_inviting_noble.GetHerHis] Hall.”\n\nA polite gesture — or something more?"

 rk_go_for_ride.0014.desc: "The morning sun dappled through the ancient canopy of the Kingswood as my household and I rode deeper along a well-worn game trail.\n\nA sudden crashing in the undergrowth, followed by a fierce, guttural snorting, brought our party to a halt. Before us, bursting from the thicket, stood a monstrous boar! Its bristling hide was caked with mud, wicked tusks curled from its snout, and its small, bloodshot eyes fixed upon us with primal fury. One of my Kingsguard instinctively shifted, hand moving towards his pommel. The beast pawed the earth, a clear challenge."

 rk_go_for_ride.0015.desc: "The countryside stretched out around us, a welcome respite from the confines of the Red Keep. As we rode at a gentle pace, I found myself alongside [rk_lord_commander.GetTitledFirstName]. He seemed more contemplative than usual, his gaze sweeping the horizon, though his hand never strayed far from his sword.\n\nAfter a companionable silence, he turned to me slightly.\n\n'Your Grace,' he said, his voice thoughtful, 'it is on rides like these, away from the whispers of court, that a man can truly take measure of the realm... and his own duties within it.'"
 rk_go_for_ride.0015.a: "And what measure do you take, Lord Commander?"
 rk_go_for_ride.0015.a_tt: "I am keen to hear his insights. A good Lord Commander sees and hears much."
 rk_go_for_ride.0015.b: "Indeed [rk_lord_commander.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. The fresh air does clear the mind."

 rk_go_for_ride.0034.desc: "Hours seem to have passed, or perhaps only minutes – time has lost all meaning in this suffocating darkness. Every passage looks like the last, every turn feels sickeningly familiar. My torch burns lower, its precious light a dwindling comfort against the encroaching gloom. The eerie clicks and whispers from the depths have become a constant, maddening backdrop, but of my men, there is still no sign, no sound.\n\nA cold knot of despair tightens in my chest. Am I merely walking in circles, a rat trapped in a lightless maze? The thought chills me to the bone. Hope, once a flickering ember, is now threatening to be extinguished entirely by the suffocating stone and silence."

 rk_go_for_ride.0035.desc: "The passage twists yet again, presenting another damnable choice. To my left, the air feels heavy, stagnant, and the tunnel is a claustrophobic squeeze that reeks of damp earth and decay. To my right, it appears to be more of the same monotonous, winding darkness I have already endured for what feels like an eternity.\n\nThe eerie sounds are all around now, or perhaps only inside my head. My torch casts long, wavering shadows, mocking any sense of direction."

To my right, the passage seems to widen almost imperceptibly, and I could swear the unsettling, eerie hum from the depths is a fraction louder, clearer from that direction, a siren's call in the dark. To my left, the tunnel remains tight, continuing its descent into absolute blackness.\n\nHope is a fragile thing in such a place."

 rk_go_for_ride.0037.desc: "I watched as [rk_lord_commander.GetTitledFirstName], torch held high, disappeared into the shadowed maw of the hidden cave. My remaining retinue and I waited, a tense silence settling over us, broken only by the rustling leaves and distant birdsong of the Kingswood. Minutes stretched into what felt like an eternity. The sun climbed higher, then began its slow descent, painting the sky in hues of orange, yet still no sign of [rk_lord_commander.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nThe entrance to the cave remained a dark, silent void. Had he found something? Was he in trouble? The eerie sounds we'd heard earlier were no longer apparent from out here, only adding to the unsettling quiet. My patience wore thin, gnawed by a growing unease for the safety of my most trusted knight."

 rk_go_for_ride.0038.desc: "Alone, I stumble onward through the suffocating blackness, my torch long since extinguished or lost. My footsteps echo unnervingly in passages that all feel the same. Hours, or perhaps an entire lifetime, seem to have crawled by since I last saw the sky, or the faces of my men. The unsettling clicks and whispers that haunted me earlier have faded, replaced now by a new sound – a clear, almost metallic *ringing*, growing steadily louder with each cautious step I take deeper into the descending gloom.\n\nIt's a strange beacon in this lightless hell. Is it a warning? A promise? Or merely another trick of this accursed place? I must have descended far beneath the Kingswood by now. My body aches, thirst parches my throat, and a chilling weariness seeps into my bones. The ringing ahead is insistent, almost hypnotic."

There, by the flames, sat an ancient woman, her face a roadmap of wrinkles, eyes glittering with an unnatural light. It was Magela, the old crone some whispered was a witch of the deep woods. And at her feet, sprawled motionless, lay [rk_lord_commander.GetTitledFirstName] – unconscious, but seemingly alive.\n\nMagela let out a dry, crackling laugh that sent shivers down my spine. "Well, well... [GetPlayer.GetTitledFirstName]. Too long it has been since one of your fine bloodlings graced my humble abode." Her gaze flickered over me, lingering on my steel, then settling on my own weary form. "Potent blood you have, [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName]. Strong. But even strong blood thins with time, eh? I can help with that." She gestured to a steaming cup beside her. "A draught of life, to restore your vigor, make you hale and hearty, like me. A small price, for such a gift. All I ask... is that you leave your pretty knight with me. He will be... company.""
