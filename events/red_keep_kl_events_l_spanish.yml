 rk_kings_landing.0001.t: "The Burdens of the Iron Throne"
 rk_kings_landing.0001_desc: "As the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, the weight of King’s Landing falls upon your shoulders. The city is vast, teeming with countless mouths to feed, and its grain reserves dwindle with each passing year. Should the harvests fail, you may need to call upon the Reach to keep famine at bay.\n\nThe loyalty of the Goldcloaks is equally vital, for without their steel the streets may descend into chaos. You must maintain strong ties with their commander, lest they turn from protectors to threats.\n\nIn times of peril, the Pyromancer’s Guild offers their deadly arts — wildfire can shield the city, but in great quantities it becomes a danger to all. Use it wisely, or risk catastrophe.\n\nFinally, the Red Keep itself stands as the heart of your reign. To rule well, you must strengthen and improve it, ensuring that the seat of power reflects the might of the Iron Throne."

Their hides are boiled on the Hook, the runoff poured into the Blackwater, and the stench spreads across half the city.\n\nThe Hand argues that curbing their industry would bring the greatest immediate relief to King’s Landing, though at an economic cost.

The Hand proposes two solutions.\n\nTo the north, the River Ros runs clean, and foreign architects from Braavos or Pentos could raise aqueducts and conduits to bring its waters into the city. Such works would be costly and demand skills unknown to Westeros.\n\nAlternatively, masons have marked several points across the city where deeper wells might be dug.

Great trenches are cut for foundations, stone is hauled from distant quarries, and scaffolds rise across the hills north of the city. Yet progress does not come without trouble.\n\nSeveral arches collapsed during the first phase, killing workers and delaying the schedule.
