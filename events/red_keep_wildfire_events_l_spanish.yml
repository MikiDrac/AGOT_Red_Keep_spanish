 rk_wildfire.0001.desc: "The Guildhall of the Alchemists looms over the Street of the Sisters, its black stone walls cold and ancient beneath the shadow of Visenya's Hill.

An enemy fleet led by [rk_invading_commander.GetTitledFirstName] has entered Blackwater Bay. They will reach the river mouth by nightfall.\n\nFrom the highest terrace of the Red Keep, you look out across the gleaming water. The sun is high, but your thoughts are already on fire and ruin.\n\nThe Sea Watch is ready, their holds packed with wildfire. One order from you, and the bay could be turned into a grave of green flame. But the risk... the risk is unimaginable."

 rk_wildfire.0007.intro: ""
 rk_wildfire.0007.attack_success: "As dusk falls, the enemy fleet sails confidently into the Blackwater, their banners high and decks bristling with soldiers.\n\nThey do not see the wildfire-laden dromons drifting innocently near the mouth of the river... until it is too late.\n\nA single torch falls — and the world erupts in green fire.\n\nThe blast tears through the bay with a sound like a god's roar. Ships vanish in pillars of flame, their crews incinerated before they can scream. The river itself seems to boil as wildfire spreads across the surface, catching ship after ship in a chain of violent destruction.\n\nWhen the smoke clears, the water glows with a sickly light. Hundreds of charred corpses float alongside the shattered remains of the enemy fleet. The Blackwater belongs to you.""
 rk_wildfire.0007.a_success: "Victory, bought with fire." 
 rk_wildfire.0007.attack_fail: "As the sun dips low over Blackwater Bay, your wildfire-laden ships drift into position. Torches are raised, the trap set — but something goes wrong.\n\nThe enemy spots the bait too early. Some ships veer off. Others scatter. The winds shift at the worst moment.\n\nWhen the fire comes, it still brings ruin. A thunderous explosion rips through the bay, igniting several enemy vessels in a brilliant surge of green flame. One ship splits in two. Another burns bow to stern before capsizing with all hands.\n\nBut the rest? Scorched, frightened, but afloat. The Blackwater runs slick with oil and bodies — yet so do enemy sails still dot the horizon."
 rk_wildfire.0007.a_fail: "Damn... it should’ve worked better."
 rk_wildfire.0007.attack_crit_fail: "All the pieces were in place. The enemy fleet sailed boldly into Blackwater Bay, right on time. Your wildfire-laden ships drifted into position. Torches were prepared. The trap was set.\n\nThen — disaster.\n\nA sudden spark. A dropped torch. A moment of wind.\n\nThe wildfire ignites too early.\n\nYour own ships explode in a chain of violent green fire, lighting the bay with sickening brilliance. Crewmen scream as they're engulfed. Burning debris rains down on your own harbor.\n\nThe enemy fleet, warned by the chaos, turns away and disperses, only partly damaged. It is a day of shame."
 rk_wildfire.0007.a_crit_fail: "Gods help us... what have we done?"
 
 rk_wildfire.0008.t: "Transmutation: A Whisper of Progress"
 rk_wildfire.0008.desc: "As you pace the torchlit corridors of the Red Keep, a cloaked figure steps from the shadows. It's Wisdom [rk_wisdom_1.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], his dark robes gleaming faintly in the gloom.\n\n\"Your Grace,\" he whispers, bowing low. \"The transmutation experiments show... promise. A residue remains behind, finer than dust, but it shimmers like gold. Our brethren are convinced we're on the cusp of something great.\""
 rk_wildfire.0008.a: "Excellent. Increase their funding."

 rk_wildfire.0009.desc: "You spot Acolyte [rk_wisdom_1.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] waiting at the foot of the Maidenvault stair, hood drawn tight despite the summer heat. As you approach, he speaks in a hushed, trembling voice.\n\n\"The substance changed, Your Grace. Not just in color or weight — it moved. Shifted. As if... alive. We contained it. For now.\" He glances over his shoulder. \"We request guidance before continuing further.\""
 rk_wildfire.0009.a: "Press on. Whatever it is, I want results."

 rk_wildfire.0010.desc: "The wind pulls at your cloak as you stand atop Maegor's Holdfast, the sea far below churning in the morning light. Waves crash like distant thunder. A whisper of footsteps behind you signals the arrival of Wisdom [rk_wisdom_1.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip].\n\n\"Your Grace,\" he says, voice thin against the wind, \"we heated the base metal beyond the limits of known flame. What emerged was... unstable. It caught the torchlight like coin, but when cooled, it wept black oil and cracked like ice. Still, it's more than we’ve ever achieved before.\""

 rk_wildfire.0011.desc: "A messenger from the Alchemists’ Guild arrives with soot still clinging to his sleeves. He bows hastily, holding out a scorched scroll sealed with the mark of Wisdom Tormos.\n\n\"A crucible burst during the final stage of heating, Your Grace. The reaction proved... more violent than our calculations allowed. One apprentice is dead, two others burned. The chamber itself is in ruins. We humbly request royal assistance to rebuild and resume our efforts.\""
 rk_wildfire.0011.a: "Spare no coin. Begin repairs at once."
 rk_wildfire.0011.a_tt: "You provide funds to restore the Guild’s ruined lab and replace the lost crucible."
 rk_wildfire.0011.a_f: "#italic Let this be the last failure before success. #!"

 rk_wildfire.0012.desc: "An acolyte alchemist kneels before the Iron Throne, a glass vial cradled in his gloved hands. The faint shimmer of quicksilver within rolls like liquid moonlight.\n\n\"We are at a standstill, Your Grace. Our stores of mercury have run dry, and the mainland supply has withered. The Guild begs permission — and coin — to import fresh stock from the markets of Lys and Qohor. Without it, our efforts stagnate.\""
 rk_wildfire.0012.a: "Very well. Secure what you need."
 rk_wildfire.0012.a_tt: "You provide funds for foreign merchants to restock the Guild’s mercury reserves."

 rk_wildfire.0013.t: "Transmutation: Furnace Collapse"
 rk_wildfire.0013.desc: "A shudder beneath the Red Keep. Then silence. Hours after dusk, word arrives from the Guild's lower chambers.\n\n\"The central furnace has collapsed, Your Grace,\"An acolyte reports, his robes dusted with ash. \"The heat warped the brick, and the stone cracked from within. Several of the lower vaults are now sealed by rubble. If we are to continue, we must rebuild — stronger, deeper, and more enduring than before.\""

He kneels quickly, avoiding your gaze.\n\n\"Your Grace,\" he says, voice trembling, \"they exposed a rat to the fumes from the transmutation chamber. It didn’t die. Its fur turned... metallic. It moves slower, but it lives. And it glistens in the dark. Wisdom Thoren says it must be studied — he believes it’s the key to organic alchemy.\"\n\nThe satchel twitches once."
 rk_wildfire.0015.a: "Fascinating. Give them what they need."

 rk_wildfire.0016.opening: "Your grace,"
 rk_wildfire.0016.desc: "Through precise heat, silver glyphs, and a powdered reagent from Yi Ti, the salt changed. It remains coarse, white, and dry — yet upon the tongue, it is sweet. Not flavored. Changed.\n\nThe transmutation was real. Proof, at last, that matter yields to will."
 rk_wildfire.0016.a: "Remarkable. Reward them!"
 rk_wildfire.0016.a_tt: "You grant the Guild a bonus for their success."

Waiting there is Wisdom Belden, his mask reflecting the flicker of flame.\n\n\"It is done, Your Grace,\" he whispers. \"The Gilded Furnace stands. We fed it a rare iron ore from the Vale — and what poured forth was gold. Heavy, warm, real. Not illusion, not plated, but true transmutation. The secret is yours. None beyond these walls need ever know.\""
