 rk_siege_defence.0001.t: "The Defence of Kings Landing"
 rk_siege_defence.0001.desc.a: "The Iron Throne weighs heavy beneath you as the war drums of Westeros echo in the distance. From the heights of Maegor’s Holdfast, the city sprawls beneath your gaze: a thousand alleys, a thousand lives.\n\nThe Red Keep has weathered many storms, but history offers no guarantee of safety. Is it folly to prepare for a siege that may never come...or madness not to?\n\nYour Master of Whispers counsels restraint, warning that panic may weaken your rule more than any sword. Yet your Master at arms, [rk_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] urges haste, insisting that delay could be your doom. The decision falls to you."
 rk_siege_defence.0001.desc.b: "The Iron Throne weighs heavy beneath you as the war drums of Westeros echo in the distance. Reports from the realm are riddled with uncertainty. Some whisper of shadowy hosts gathering, while others scoff at such rumors, claiming the storm lies far from our gates.\nFrom the heights of Maegor’s Holdfast, the city sprawls beneath your gaze: a thousand alleys, a thousand lives. The Red Keep has weathered many storms, but history offers no guarantee of safety. Is it folly to prepare for a siege that may never come...or madness not to?\nYour Master of Whispers counsels restraint, warning that panic may weaken your rule more than any sword. Having named no Master at Arms, it is up to you, the King to oversee the defence of the city."
 rk_siege_defence.0001.a: "I shall oversee the city's defenses myself."
 rk_siege_defence.0001.a_tt: "You personally lead the defense efforts of King’s Landing."
 rk_siege_defence.0001.f: "Your royal presence can have the strongest impact in the preparations."
 rk_siege_defence.0001.b: "[rk_marshal.GetTitledFirstName], begin preparations for a siege."
 rk_siege_defence.0001.b_tt: "Your [marshal|E] is tasked with overseeing the city's defense preparations. [rk_marshal.GetHerHis|U] [martial|E] skill will determine the outcome."
 rk_siege_defence.0001.c: "My Hand, [rk_castellan.GetTitledFirstName] will see to it."
 rk_siege_defence.0001.c_tt: "Your Hand of the King is tasked with preparing King's Landing for war. [rk_castellan.GetHerHis|U] [stewardship|E] skill will determine de outcome." 
 rk_siege_defence.0001.d: "Nonsense, the enemy will never even see our walls!"
 rk_siege_defence.0001.d_tt: "You decide that the enemy is too far away to be a direct threat and choose not to fortify the city."  
 
 rk_siege_defence.0002.t: "[rk_marshal.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] Reports"
 rk_siege_defence.0002.desc: "My Master-at-Arms, [rk_marshal.GetTitledFirstName], was entrusted with overseeing the reinforcement of King's Landing. The period of intense preparation has concluded,and he now reports on the state of the capital's defenses.\n\nThe security of my throne and the lives of countless citizens depend on the efficacy of [rk_marshal.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] work. Let us now see how well he has done..." 
 rk_siege_defence.0002.a: "The results are... concerning."
 rk_siege_defence.0002.a_tt: "Despite [rk_marshal.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] efforts, [rk_marshal.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] direction has yielded little improvement to the [GetTitleByKey('c_kings_landing').GetName]'s fortifications"
 rk_siege_defence.0002.b: "A satisfactory effort."
 rk_siege_defence.0002.b_tt: "[rk_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] has ensured the [GetTitleByKey('c_kings_landing').GetName]'s basic fortifications are bolstered, and the walls stand ready."
 rk_siege_defence.0002.c: "Well done! Our defenses are significantly improved."
 rk_siege_defence.0002.c_tt: "[rk_marshal.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] skill and diligence are evident. [GetTitleByKey('c_kings_landing').GetName] is substantially more formidable." 
 rk_siege_defence.0002.d: "Magnificent! King's Landing is a true fortress!"
 rk_siege_defence.0002.d_tt: "Under [rk_marshal.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] expert supervision, [GetTitleByKey('c_kings_landing').GetName] has been transformed into a bastion of strength. Any attacking force will surely rue the day they decided to test these walls!"  
 
 rk_siege_defence.0003.t: "Hand's Report: King's Landing Fortifications"
 rk_siege_defence.0003.desc: "My Hand of the King, [rk_castellan.GetTitledFirstName], was charged with the crucial task of overseeing the reinforcement of King's Landing's defenses. After a period of dedicated effort (or so I hope), [rk_castellan.GetTitledFirstName] now presents [rk_castellan.GetHerHis] findings on the state of our capital's preparedness. The well-being of my people and the integrity of my rule rest heavily on the outcome of [rk_castellan.GetHerHis] stewardship.\n\n Let us now see the results..." 
 rk_siege_defence.0003.a: "The ledgers show... concerning deficiencies."
 rk_siege_defence.0003.a_tt: "[rk_castellan.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] administrative efforts have unfortunately fallen short. The planned improvements appear to have been poorly managed or inadequately funded, potentially even weakening existing structures."  
 rk_siege_defence.0003.b: "A competent effort. The city is more secure."
 rk_siege_defence.0003.b_tt: "[rk_castellan.GetTitledFirstName] has competently organized the necessary works. Resources were allocated efficiently, and the city's basic defensive posture has been improved."  
 rk_siege_defence.0003.c: "Well administered! Our defenses are substantially enhanced."
 rk_siege_defence.0003.c_tt: "My Hand's keen administrative skill and diligent oversight are clear. King's Landing is now significantly more resilient, with resources well-marshalled and fortifications notably strengthened."  
 rk_siege_defence.0003.d: "Exemplary work! King's Landing is a true bastion!"
 rk_siege_defence.0003.d_tt: "Under [rk_castellan.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] masterful administration, The [GetTitleByKey('c_kings_landing').GetName]'s defenses have been elevated to an exceptional standard. Logistics, supplies, and structural integrity are all impeccable. The capital stands as a testament to [rk_castellan.GetHerHis] profound abilities!"   
 
 rk_siege_defence.0004.t: "The Burden of the City"
 rk_siege_defence.0004.desc: "Accompanied by your Kingsguard, you start your review by walking through the narrow, crowded streets of the capital. The poor, displaced by the war, fill the alleys and squares, refugees mingling with the city's own struggling population. You see they are mostly rural peasants, running away from the rumours of war and into the security of our walls.\n\nSupplies are not yet strained, but the signs are there: longer bread lines, merchants tightening their stock, tempers fraying in crowded markets. The Gold Cloaks are stretched thin, and whispers of unrest ripple through the city’s slums.\n\nNow, a grim choice lies before you..."
 rk_siege_defence.0004.a: "Expel the mouths we don't need."
 rk_siege_defence.0004.a_tt: "The city cannot support everyone in times of war. We must remove the poorest and the refugees to preserve the city's limited supplies."
 rk_siege_defence.0004.b: "Welcome the peasants into the city."
 rk_siege_defence.0004.b_tt: "You allow the refugees and peasants to seek shelter within the [GetTitleByKey('c_kings_landing').GetName], prioritizing compassion but increasing the strain on your supplies."
 rk_siege_defence.0004.c: "Close the gates but care for our own."
 rk_siege_defence.0004.c_tt: "The city's resources are stretched thin. No more peasants may enter, but we will take care of our citizens who are already here."

 rk_siege_defence.0005.t: "A Visit to the Fletchers and Engineers"
 rk_siege_defence.0005.desc.a: "You stroll along the towering walls of the Red Keep, your gaze falling on the armory below, where the fletchers and smiths are hard at work. Comming down to the workshop, the air smells of iron and wood as your eyes sweep over the stockpiles of weapons and defenses.\n\n[rk_marshal.GetTitledFirstName], your Master at Arms approaches you with a dilemma. The wood supplies are limited, and you must decide how to use them. The fletchers are eager to increase the production of arrows to arm the archers, but the engineers suggest that the time may be right to construct new trebuchets to bolster the walls. You know that whichever path you choose, it will consume the last of your wood reserves."
 rk_siege_defence.0005.desc.b: "You stroll along the towering walls of the Red Keep, your gaze falling on the armory below, where the fletchers and smiths are hard at work. Comming down to the workshop, the air smells of iron and wood as your eyes sweep over the stockpiles of weapons and defenses.\n\nThe chief engineer approaches you with a dilemma. The wood supplies are limited, and you must decide how to use them. The fletchers are eager to increase the production of arrows to arm the archers, but the engineers suggest that the time may be right to construct new trebuchets to bolster the walls. You know that whichever path you choose, it will consume the last of your wood reserves."
 rk_siege_defence.0005.a: "Focus on arrows. The archers will need them."
 rk_siege_defence.0005.a_tt: "Allocate the wood to the fletchers to ensure the [garrison|E] is well-supplied with arrows for the coming months."
 rk_siege_defence.0005.b: "Build trebuchets to strengthen the walls."
 rk_siege_defence.0005.b_tt: "Invest in the construction of trebuchets to bolster the defenses of the [GetTitleByKey('c_kings_landing').GetName]."
 rk_siege_defence.0005.c: "It is too expensive. We will save the coin."
 rk_siege_defence.0005.c_tt: "Decide not to spend the wood or resources, preserving the treasury but leaving your defenses unchanged."

 rk_siege_defence.0006.t: "A Cloak of Gold"
 rk_siege_defence.0006.desc: "The great doors of the throne room groan open, and [rk_goldcloak_commander.GetTitledFirstName], the Commander of the City Watch strides across the black marble floor beneath the vaulted ceiling. His armor is worn but clean, his golden cloak trailing behind him like a banner of smoke. He kneels, head bowed—not as a courtier, but as a soldier awaiting orders.\n\n #italic “Rise,”#! you command.#italic “We must speak of the city’s defenses.”#!\n\nKing’s Landing has withstood fire and steel before—but you will not trust to chance. The Gold Cloaks must be made ready. Whether through fire-forged loyalty, sheer numbers, or trusted hands, you intend to see the city stand should war come to its gates.\n\n The Commander straightens, silent and attentive. The Watch is yours to command. How will you shape it?"
 rk_siege_defence.0006.a: "Expand the Watch with able men."
 rk_siege_defence.0006.a_tt: "Numbers win [sieges|E] as surely as walls. You open recruitment to the common folk—men with empty bellies and quick hands. The new recruits will be vetted, trained, and armed at Crown expense. Not all will be loyal, but all will obey. For now."
 rk_siege_defence.0006.b: "Take whoever can carry a sword."
 rk_siege_defence.0006.b_tt: "Standards are lowered, and the #m Gold Cloaks#! swell with peasants, cutthroats, and drunks looking for coin. It's fast and cheap—but discipline may suffer."
 rk_siege_defence.0006.c: "Purge the disloyal."
 rk_siege_defence.0006.c_tt: "You command a cleansing of the Watch—no new blood, only loyalty. Bribe-takers and cowards are rooted out, and the rest stand straighter in their wake." 
 rk_siege_defence.0006.d: "Leave it up to [rk_goldcloak_commander.GetTitledFirstName]."
 rk_siege_defence.0006.d_tt: "You wave the matter aside, trusting the Commander to maintain the Watch as he sees fit. He nods—but makes no move to change anything."  

 rk_siege_defence.0007.t: "The Royal Fleet"
 rk_siege_defence.0007.desc.a: "The salty wind bites at your cloak as you descend the steps of the Red Keep and make your way down to the docks. Blackwater Bay stretches before you—wide, grey, and restless. Moored at anchor, the Royal Fleet creaks and sways in the tide, a force of iron and oak awaiting your command.\n\nYour Master of Ships, [rk_admiral.GetTitledFirstName] joins you at the pier, nodding respectfully before gesturing toward the vessels. Together, you walk the length of the waterfront, discussing the part the fleet might play in the war to come.\n\nYou could position the fleet within the bay, [rk_admiral.GetTitledFirstName] suggests forming a wall of wood and fire to block any hostile landing and aid in a possible siege—but such a deployment would leave merchant ships vulnerable and trade revenue diminished.\n\nAlternatively, the fleet could patrol the Narrow Sea, protecting commerce and warding off opportunistic corsairs and raiders.\n\nOr, should you anticipate a campaign abroad, you may order the fleet prepared to serve as transports—sacrificing immediate naval strength for future mobility.\n\nThe wind shifts. Sails ripple. A decision must be made."

 rk_siege_defence.0007.a: "Deploy the fleet across the Blackwater."
 rk_siege_defence.0007.a_tt: " The #E Royal Fleet#! will form a barrier across Blackwater Bay, guarding the capital from amphibious assault and lending strength to your siege defenses."
 rk_siege_defence.0007.b: "Send the fleet to patrol the Narrow Sea."
 rk_siege_defence.0007.b_tt: "The ships will range eastward, protecting your merchant lanes and scouring the waters for corsairs. The capital gains no protection, but commerce flows undisturbed."
 rk_siege_defence.0007.c: "Ready the ships as transports."
 rk_siege_defence.0007.c_tt: "The #E Royal Fleet#! will be stocked and staffed for rapid embarkation of your armies. The ships cannot defend the capital while they prepare for war elsewhere."
 
 
 rk_siege_defence.0008.t: "Upon the City Walls"
 rk_siege_defence.0008.desc: "From first light until dusk, you walk the circuit of King’s Landing’s ancient walls, your boots echoing on worn stone as the wind carries the scent of salt and smoke from the bay. At each of the Seven Gates, your entourage pauses—guard captains offer terse salutes, while the Hand of the King offers murmured counsel between glances at the crumbling mortar and warped ironwork.\n\nThe city stretches beneath you in all directions, a vast sprawl of life clinging to the hillsides and crowded streets, depending on these very walls to keep them safe. And yet, even to the untrained eye, faults are visible—sections where the stone has bowed, where ivy hides long-forgotten cracks, where time has done what war could not.\n\nSomething must be done. The masons whisper of urgent repairs but our Master of Coin calls for caution. You weigh your choices, the Red Keep rising behind you like a final bastion of strength—or pride."
 rk_siege_defence.0008.a: "The Stonemasons must reinforce the walls!"
 rk_siege_defence.0008.a_tt: "You spare no expense, bringing in skilled masons and fresh-cut stone from the Crownlands. The walls will stand, stronger than they have in a century—but the treasury will bleed for it."
 rk_siege_defence.0008.b: "Erect wooden barricades where needed."
 rk_siege_defence.0008.b_tt: "Carpenters and laborers get to work overnight, raising timber towers and bracing the weakest stretches of wall. It is a temporary fix—but war often rewards speed over beauty."
 rk_siege_defence.0008.c: "Focus our efforts on fortifying the Red Keep."
 rk_siege_defence.0008.c_tt: "Let the city look to its own defenses—your concern lies with the Red Keep. If the outer walls fall, the true battle will begin atop Aegon’s Hill."
 rk_siege_defence.0008.d: "Our walls ar thick, they will stand."
 rk_siege_defence.0008.d_tt: "You order no changes. Whether out of confidence or calculation, you leave the stone as it is—and place your faith in fate, or fear." 
 
 rk_siege_defence.0009.t: "The City Stands Ready"
 rk_siege_defence.0009.desc: "The scent of ash hangs faint in the morning air, and the mood within the walls has turned grim and quiet. Eyes linger longer at the gates, whispers hush when riders pass, and the bells seem heavier with each toll.\n\nFrom the Great Sept to the Dragonpit, King's Landing braces for the storm. Whatever comes, the city will not fall easily."
 rk_siege_defence.0009.a: "Let them come if they dare."
 rk_siege_defence.0009.a_tt: "You have finished preparing King's Landing for war."
