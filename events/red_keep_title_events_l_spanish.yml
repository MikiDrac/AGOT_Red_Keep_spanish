 rk_crackclaw.0001.t: "The Broken Claw"
 rk_crackclaw.0001.desc: "You summon your Hand, [rk_hand.GetTitledFirstName], to your solar to speak of Crackclaw Point. The peninsula remains divided—its lords feuding and divided, its loyalty uncertain.\n\n\"Crackclaw Point has always been a land of bogs, proud warriors, and stubborn houses,\" your Hand says. \"The Brunes, Crabs, Boggs, and Pynes each cling to old rights, answering only to the Crown since the times of Aegon the Conqueror.\"\n\n[rk_hand.GetSheHe|U] pauses.\n\n\"If we mean to bring order and unity, Your Grace, we must first understand the land. A royal envoy should be sent to survey the region and speak with its lords.\""
 rk_crackclaw.0001.a: "Send a royal envoy to Crackclaw Point."
 rk_crackclaw.0001.a_tt: "A royal envoy will be selected to assess the situation in Crackclaw Point."
 rk_crackclaw.0001.b: "Do nothing—for now."
 rk_crackclaw.0001.b_tt: "You choose not to act on the unrest in Crackclaw Point at this time."

 rk_crackclaw.0002.t: "The Broken Claw: A Royal Envoy"
 rk_crackclaw.0002.desc: "In the echoing chamber of the Iron Throne, your Hand approaches with a bow. Preparations for the royal survey of Crackclaw Point are underway, and now the matter turns to choosing who will carry your authority.\n\n\"Your Grace,\" the Hand begins, "this task requires care. We may dispatch [rk_envoy_1.GetTitledFirstName] a skilled administrator from my household, very reliable and disciplined—or perhaps a lesser noble of Crackclaw blood like [rk_envoy_2.GetTitledFirstName] who now serves here in the capital. He knows the land and its people."\n\nThe court awaits your decision in silence."
 rk_crackclaw.0002.a: "Send [rk_envoy_1.GetTitledFirstName], [rk_hand.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] administrator."
 rk_crackclaw.0002.a_tt: "A skilled official with no ties to the region. He will take a measured, formal approach."
 rk_crackclaw.0002.b: "Send [rk_envoy_2.GetTitledFirstName], the Clawman."
 rk_crackclaw.0002.b_tt: "Born of the bogs, Lymond knows the people and the politics of Crackclaw Point."
 rk_crackclaw.0002.c: "Send [rk_hand.GetTitledFirstName] [rk_hand.GetHerselfHimself]."
 rk_crackclaw.0002.c_tt: "A show of royal authority."
 
 rk_crackclaw.0003.t: "The Broken Claw: The Envoy Returns"
 rk_crackclaw.0003.desc.1: "[rk_envoy_1.GetTitledFirstName], your envoy to Crackclaw Point, has returned with meticulous reports. His notes emphasize the stubborn independence of the Crackclaw houses, though he observed some lords showing cautious deference to the Crown’s authority.\n\nHe recommends steady diplomacy and formal governance structures, proposing a High Lordship under Dyre Den as a means to establish lasting order."
 rk_crackclaw.0003.desc.2: "[rk_envoy_2.GetTitledFirstName], your envoy to Crackclaw Point, returned with firsthand accounts. He tells of ancient grudges simmering beneath polite words, and houses ready to test any new authority.\n\nYet, he found a few lords willing to listen—especially if led by one of their own. His counsel is to move carefully, honoring local customs, while positioning Dyre Den to lead as High Lord."
 rk_crackclaw.0003.desc.3: "[rk_hand.GetTitledFirstName], the Hand of the King, has returned from Crackclaw Point bearing a weighty report. [rk_hand.GetHerHis] presence was noted by all, commanding respect but also stirring unease.\n\n[rk_hand.GetSheHe|U] confirms the peninsula’s fractured loyalties and warns that swift, strong action is needed. [rk_hand.GetSheHe|U] advises formalizing a High Lordship under Dyre Den to bring the region under one banner, while preparing for any dissent." 
 rk_crackclaw.0003.a: "Summon the Lord of Dyre Den to the Red Keep."
 rk_crackclaw.0003.a_tt: "Begin formal talks to establish the High Lordship."
 rk_crackclaw.0003.b: "Leave matters be for now."
 rk_crackclaw.0003.b_tt: "Hold back for now on any centralisation."
 
 rk_crackclaw.0004.t: "The Broken Claw: Before the Iron Throne"
 rk_crackclaw.0004.desc:  "The great doors of the throne room creak open, and [rk_dyrehost.GetTitledFirstName] steps forward beneath the vaulted ceiling. The hall is hushed as he kneels at the foot of the Iron Throne, eyes raised to meet yours.\n\n\"Your Grace,\" [rk_dyrehost.GetSheHe] says, voice steady. \"You summon me regarding the matter of Crackclaw Point. I know its bogs, its blood feuds, and its bitter pride. If unity is to be forged, it will not come by sword alone.\"\n\nYou declare your intent: that the realm shall support his efforts to bring order to the peninsula — not by edict, but by council and consent. [rk_dyrehost.GetSheHe|U] listens, grave and thoughtful.\n\n\"Then I will return to Dyre Den,\" he says. \"And I shall summon the other houses. If they will come, we will speak. Let the bog choose its master, if one is to be named.\""
 rk_crackclaw.0004.a: "May [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm2] guide your task."
 rk_crackclaw.0004.a_tt: "[rk_dyrehost.GetTitledFirstName] returns home to summon the lords of Crackclaw Point."
 rk_crackclaw.0004.b: "I need to reconsider this."
 rk_crackclaw.0004.b_tt: "You decide against centralisation of Cracklaw Point."

 rk_crackclaw.0005.t: "The Broken Claw: Before the Iron Throne"
 rk_crackclaw.0005.desc: "Before departing the Red Keep, [rk_dyrehost.GetTitledFirstName] turns back to you.\n\n\"One last thing, Your Grace,\" [rk_dyrehost.GetSheHe] says. \"If I am to bring the lords of Crackclaw Point to my hall, I must carry more than your word. The other houses test me, and I must not arrive empty-handed.\"\n\nHe bows his head slightly. \"Will you grant me something to aid this effort — a sign of your favor, to steady their pride and calm their doubts?\""
 rk_crackclaw.0005.a: "Take my seal, you are my voice."
 rk_crackclaw.0005.a_tt: "[rk_dyrehost.GetHerHis|U] authority is sealed by royal proclamation."
 rk_crackclaw.0005.b: "Impress the nobles with gifts."
 rk_crackclaw.0005.b_tt: "[rk_dyrehost.GetSheHe|U] will host the lords with Crown-funded hospitality."
 rk_crackclaw.0005.c: "The High Septon will bless you."
 rk_crackclaw.0005.c_tt: "[rk_dyrehost.GetHerHis|U] cause will carry the Faith's approval."
 
 rk_crackclaw.0006.t: "A Letter from Dyre Den"
 rk_crackclaw.0006.opening: "Your Grace," 
 rk_crackclaw.0006.desc: "After days of gathering, the lords of Crackclaw Point have assembled at Dyre Den. Yet, old rivalries remain unyielding, and the council has failed to reach any lasting accord.\nThey now demand your presence in person — only your voice, as sovereign, can bind them together in peace. If you choose not to come, this endeavor risks unraveling into open defiance and chaos. The fate of Crackclaw Point lies in your hands."
 rk_crackclaw.0006.a: "I will journey to Dyre Den and bring unity."
 rk_crackclaw.0006.a_tt: "Answer the summons and lead the council personally."
 rk_crackclaw.0006.b: "Their demands are an insult; I abandon this venture."
 rk_crackclaw.0006.b_tt: "Refuse the summons and end the attempt at unification."
 
 rk_crackclaw.0007.t: "The Broken Claw: The Gates of Dyre Den"
 rk_crackclaw.0007.desc: "The wind bites as your retinue crests the final ridge. Before you stands Dyre Den — a small, weather-beaten castle crouched on a cliff above the bay, its three crooked towers jutting skyward like broken teeth. A stony path snakes steeply up through a narrow cleft in the rock, the only way in from the road below. Pine forests stretch into the misty distance, broken only by gray hills and bogwater. The air smells of salt, damp earth, and old stone.\n\nThe lords of these lands are loyal, but proud. They’ve bent the knee to the Crown for centuries — but they hold tight to their ways. They won’t look kindly on any man who tries to raise one house above the rest.\n\nYou tighten your reins as Dyre Den looms ahead..."
 rk_crackclaw.0007.a: "The lords are waiting."
 rk_crackclaw.0007.a_tt: "You enter the castle to start the council."
 
 rk_crackclaw.0008.t: "The Broken Claw: The Council at Dyre Den"
 rk_crackclaw.0008.desc: "The lords of Crackclaw Point sit around the long table in the great hall of Dyre Den, the wind howling faintly through the stonework. They regard one another with guarded expressions — old grudges and rivalries flickering just beneath the surface.\n\nThe Lord of Dyre Den stands at your side, calm but tense. \"They will not bend easily, Your Grace. Let them speak. They must feel heard if any peace is to come of this.\""
 rk_crackclaw.0008.a: "Let them speak. We are here to listen."
 rk_crackclaw.0008.a_tt: "Hear their grievances and show them respect."
 rk_crackclaw.0008.b: "Enough. I will speak first."
 rk_crackclaw.0008.b_tt: "Assert your authority and take control."
 
 rk_crackclaw.0009.t: "The Broken Claw: A Time to Speak"
 rk_crackclaw.0009.desc: "The lords have aired their complaints — land disputes, insulted ancestors, questions of ancient precedence. They speak of their loyalty to the crown and of their freedom and ancient rights. Their voices fade, and all turn to you.\n\nThis is your moment to set the tone for the rest of the council. The path you choose now may well determine whether unity is forged — or lost."
 rk_crackclaw.0009.a: "This realm needs order..."
 rk_crackclaw.0009.a_tt: "You speak with strength and finality, as a ruler above all."
 rk_crackclaw.0009.b: "Your loyalty is remembered. And it is honored..."
 rk_crackclaw.0009.b_tt: "Appeal to their pride and tradition."
 
 rk_crackclaw.0010.t: "The Broken Claw: One Voice Among Many"
 rk_crackclaw.0010.desc: "You being your speech appealing to the pride of the clawmen:\n\n #italic "I know the tales of Crackclaw — of how your grandfathers swore to Visenya on their knees, but never to each other. You are men of the marsh and shore, unbowed and proud. That is no fault — it is your strength. I do not ask you to break your customs. I ask you to preserve your land — united, not divided."#!\n\nAs you finish, [rk_dyrehost.GetTitledFirstName] rises, [rk_dyrehost.GetHerHis] voice echoing off the stone walls. \"Let us not waste time. My house has stood longer, fought harder, and holds more men than any other. It is only right we lead.\"\n\nThe air shifts. Others glance toward you, some with worry, others with narrowed eyes."
 rk_crackclaw.0010.a: "His claim is well-founded."
 rk_crackclaw.0010.a_tt: "You acknowledge [rk_dyrehost.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] case."
 rk_crackclaw.0010.b: "You speak boldly [rk_dyrehost.GetTitledFirstName], but too soon."
 rk_crackclaw.0010.b_tt: "You temper the moment, urging patience from all."
 
 rk_crackclaw.0011.t: "The Broken Claw: A Crowned Compromise"
 rk_crackclaw.0011.desc:  "The hall of Dyre Den falls into a heavy silence. After hours of veiled insults, stubborn boasts, and old grievances rehashed, no house dares name another as their better — nor will they name themselves.\n\n[rk_dyrehost.GetTitledFirstName] steps forward at last. \"Your Grace,\" he says carefully, \"we cannot come to terms amongst ourselves. Yet if the Crown would raise a new high lordship, and bestow it upon one of us, we will honor that judgment. We will bend — if it is Your Grace who binds us.\"\n\nThere is reluctance in their eyes, but no voices rise in protest. They are proud folk, but they know an end must come."
 rk_crackclaw.0011.a: "So it shall be. I will name a High Lord in time."
 rk_crackclaw.0011.a_tt: "You gain the High Lordship of Crackclaw Point and may now grant it as you see fit."

 rk_crackclaw.0012.t: "The Broken Claw: A Council Broken"
 rk_crackclaw.0012.desc: "No sooner have your final words left your lips than the hall of Dyre Den erupts into shouting. The gathered lords rise to their feet, voices sharp with anger and wounded pride. Old rivalries flare anew, and whatever fragile accord might have been reached dissolves like mist.\n\n[rk_dyrehost.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] turns to you, jaw clenched. \"Forgive them, Your Grace. This land is proud and slow to change. Without unity, there can be no High Lord. Not today.\"\n\nThere will be no peace — not yet."
 rk_crackclaw.0012.a: "A shame. We were close."
 rk_crackclaw.0012.a_tt: "The council collapses in discord. Crackclaw Point remains divided."
 rk_crackclaw.0012.b: "There is no hope for you people!"
 rk_crackclaw.0012.b_tt: "The council collapses in discord. Crackclaw Point remains divided."
 
 rk_crackclaw.0013.t: "The Broken Claw: No Word from Crackclaw" 
 rk_crackclaw.0013.desc: "The weeks pass, and no word returns from Crackclaw Point. Your emissary rode forth under royal banner, but the peninsula is wild and tangled — all hills, bogs, and silence.\n\nNow a rider from Maidenpool brings grim whispers: your envoy was last seen heading toward the Pine Barrens... and then vanished.\n\nThe land is not lawless, but it is proud and wary of outsiders. This may be a message — or a tragedy."
 rk_crackclaw.0013.a: "Damn this cursed, mist-choked land..."
 rk_crackclaw.0013.a_tt: "The emissary is lost. The effort falters before it began."
 
 rk_landingfield.0001.t: "A Royal Demesne"
 rk_landingfield.0001.desc: "By law and by right, all Westeros bends the knee to me. The Crownlands are my personal demesne, yet when I look to my own ledgers, I find little beyond the Red Keep's vaults and walls.\n\nI am a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName|U] in name, ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, yet in practice my grasp tightens only around these red stone halls. Beyond King's Landing, fertile lands stretch north — arable fields, rivers flowing clear, villages ripe for royal stewardship.\n\nIt would be wise, and just, to claim them directly. A [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName|U] should not rely wholly on the coin of others to fill his coffers."
 rk_landingfield.0001.a: "Summon the Hand of the King."
 rk_landingfield.0001.a_tt: "You Summon your Lord Hand to discuss the possibility of expanding your royal demesne."
 rk_landingfield.0001.b: "I rule through my vassals."
 rk_landingfield.0001.b_tt: "You decide against the idea." 
 
 rk_landingfield.0002.t: "The Hand's Counsel"
 rk_landingfield.0002.desc: "[rk_hand.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] arrives in my chambers at my summons. I speak plainly: the Iron Throne rules the Seven Kingdoms, yet my own holdings feel constrained—limited to the Red Keep and its grounds.\n\n"It would serve both crown and realm to expand my personal demesne," I say. "The question is where."\n\n[rk_hand.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], ever measured, considers before replying: "There are communal lands north of King’s Landing—villages and fields along the Ros. Their ownership is scattered. With a proper survey, we could bring them under royal control without much unrest."\n\nA sound suggestion. Arable land, near the capital, already under crown influence. And as [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName|U], I need not ask leave—only act."
 rk_landingfield.0002.a: "Carry out the Survey, [rk_hand.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 rk_landingfield.0002.a_tt: "You order the survey."
 rk_landingfield.0002.b: "Best we leave it for now."
 rk_landingfield.0002.b_tt: "You change your mind."

 rk_landingfield.0003.opening: "Your Grace,"
 rk_landingfield.0003.desc: "The survey is complete. The communal lands surrounding the [GetTitleByKey('b_landingfield').GetName] show great promise: fertile fields, ample river access, and an expanding town that could serve the Crown well.\n\nI advise the construction of a royal keep to secure these lands under your direct control. Such a project would require funds to compensate the smallfolk for the loss of their communal lands. The cost is not insignificant, but it would spare us unnecessary trouble.\n\nBy your leave, I await your command."
 rk_landingfield.0003.a: "Compensate the peasants."
 rk_landingfield.0003.a_tt: "You will pay to secure the land peacefully."
 rk_landingfield.0003.b: "Seize the land by force."
 rk_landingfield.0003.b_tt: "You will take the land without payment."
 rk_landingfield.0003.c: "Leave the matter for now."
 rk_landingfield.0003.c_tt: "[GetTitleByKey('b_landingfield').GetName] remains in its current state." 
 
 rk_landingfield.0004.opening: "Your Grace,"
 rk_landingfield.0004.desc: "The works at Landingfield are finished. The keep stands tall above the fields, its walls strong, its banners bearing your royal sigil. Administrative offices have been established, and the local lands now fall fully under direct crown control.\n\nIf it pleases Your Grace, you may ride to Landingfield to see it with your own eyes. The people would take it as a sign of royal favor."
 rk_landingfield.0004.a: "I will visit the keep in person."
 rk_landingfield.0004.a_tt: "You decide to visit your new holding in person."
 rk_landingfield.0004.b: "Good. Let the work continue without me."
 rk_landingfield.0004.b_tt: "You decide against travelling to Landingfield."
 
 
 rk_landingfield.0005.t: "Arrival at [GetTitleByKey('b_landingfield').GetName]"
 rk_landingfield.0005.desc: "I leave King’s Landing through the Old Gate, my retinue riding close behind. The King’s Road stretches north, the dust rising in our wake.\n\nBefore long, the walls of the city fall behind me, replaced by open fields. Wheat sways in the wind—fertile lands promised by the survey. The River Ros glimmers to the east, its waters calm and steady.\n\nAcross the river, I spot Hayford Castle: round towers of pale stone rising above the trees, a quiet reminder that even here, I am not the only power.\n\nSoon, Landingfield comes into view: a growing town, and soon enough, the seat of my new royal holding."
 rk_landingfield.0005.a: "A fine place to increase my power."
 rk_landingfield.0005.a_tt: "You tour your newly aquired demesne and return to King's Landing."
 
 rk_landingfield.0006.t: "Whispers in the Halls" 
 rk_landingfield.0006.desc: "[rk_spymaster.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] arrives in the solar, having requested an audience early this morning.\n\n“Your Grace,” [rk_spymaster.GetSheHe] says quietly, “there are whispers at court. Some lords say the new keep at Landingfield is a sign the Crown’s coffers run dry—claiming you build like a landed knight, scrabbling for fields and taxes. Others murmur that you raise castles not for defense, but to keep watch over your own bannermen."\n\n"Whoever adviced Your Grace for this endevour might not have your best interest at heart.”" 
 rk_landingfield.0006.a: "Let them talk. I rule, not them."
 rk_landingfield.0006.a_tt: "You ignore the rumours." 
 rk_landingfield.0006.b: "Find out who spreads these lies. Quiet them."
 rk_landingfield.0006.b_tt: "You command [rk_spymaster.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] to silence the rumours."  
 
 #### LP EVENTS
 
 rk_lps.0001.t: "The Western Shore"
 rk_lps.0001.desc: "[rk_lp_westerlands.GetTitledFirstName] of the Westerlands arrives in the Red Keep, his voice dripping with feigned humility.\n\n"Your Grace, the Ironborn have taken to raiding our coasts again. They are no more than petty bands, yes, but they cause havoc and spill [rk_lp_westerlands.GetDynasty.GetNameNoTooltip] blood. I humbly request permission to expand my forces and maintain a #italic permanent#! coastal defense force at my own expense, to guard the western shores from these sea-wolves.""
 rk_lps.0001.a: "You may raise your coastal guard."
 rk_lps.0001.a_tt: "You allow [rk_lp_westerlands.GetTitledFirstName] to expand his forces."

 rk_lps.0001.b_tt: "You send your own men to guard the western coasts."
 rk_lps.0001.c: "Absolutely not. No standing armies without the King's leave."
 rk_lps.0001.c_tt: "You deny [rk_lp_westerlands.GetTitledFirstName]'s request." 
 
 rk_lps.0002.t: "Winter Stores are Running Low"
 rk_lps.0002.desc: "[rk_lp_north.GetTitledFirstName] stands before the Iron Throne after a long journey with grim tidings. A poor harvest in the North, coupled with early snow, has left the North's winter stores dangerously depleted. \n\n\"Your Grace,\" the [rk_lp_north.GetLadyLord] says, bowing stiffly, \"I have journeyed all the way from the North with grave news. Our people will starve before the thaw. We ask that the Crown send grain from the South before the snows close the roads and freeze the ports. The North remembers its friends...\""
 rk_lps.0002.a: "Empty the royal granaries."
 rk_lps.0002.a_tt: "You send a large shipment of grain to the North."

 rk_lps.0002.c_tt: "You refuse the request."  
 
 rk_lps.0003.t: "Tolls for the Trident"
 rk_lps.0003.desc: "[rk_lp_riverlands.GetTitledFirstName] of the Riverlands arrives at court with a proposal “to ensure the prosperity and defense of the Riverlands.” He argues that the great rivers — the Trident, the Red Fork, the Tumblestone — are the lifeblood of Westerosi trade, yet ships and barges pass freely without contributing to the upkeep of bridges, docks, and patrols.\n\n“Your Grace,” he declares, “with royal permission, I would levy a modest toll on vessels passing along the Trident and its tributaries. The revenues would strengthen our defenses against raiders and enrich the realm’s coffers. Surely all who profit from our waters should help protect them.”"
 rk_lps.0003.a: "Do as you please, [rk_lp_riverlands.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 rk_lps.0003.a_tt: "You allow [rk_lp_riverlands.GetTitledFirstName] to set up the tolls."
 rk_lps.0003.b: "A fair toll... if shared with the Throne."
 rk_lps.0003.b_tt: "You allow the tolls on the condition they are shared with the crown."

 rk_nw.0002.desc: "Alone in my chambers within the Red Keep, I pore over the latest raven from the Wall. My eyes drift to a map of Westeros spread upon my desk, the Wall’s black line stark against the snowbound North.\n\nFew kings have laid eyes upon that ancient barrier — fewer still have stood atop it since the days of Aegon the Conqueror. The thought of riding north, to see its strength and the men who guard it, stirs something within me."
 rk_nw.0002.a: "I will ride north at once."
 rk_nw.0002.a_tt: "You prepare to depart for the Wall."

 rk_nw.0004.t: "The Wall in Sight"
 rk_nw.0004.desc: "The wind bites hard as the road crests a low rise, and then I see it — the Wall. A sheer cliff of ice, impossibly tall, stretching from horizon to horizon. Castle Black huddles at its base like a shadow clinging to a mountain.\n\nThe air feels older here, heavy with the weight of centuries and the oaths sworn to guard the realm from whatever lies beyond that frozen height."

 rk_nw.0005.desc: "The wind bites as we ride through Castle Black’s open gates, the Wall looming above — a cliff of blue-white ice that swallows the sky. Black-clad brothers stand in silent ranks, breath drifting in the frigid air; some stand straight and proud, others lean wearily on their spears.\n\nAt their head waits the Lord Commander, cloak heavy with fur. He bows and says, “Your Grace, Castle Black is honored by your presence. The men await you in the hall, the winch cage stands ready, and a place is set at our table.”"
 rk_nw.0005.a: "Show me the Wall first."

 rk_nw.0006.t: "Atop the Wall"
 rk_nw.0006.desc: "The winch cage rattles skyward. Cold knifes through fur and mail as the world drops away, until only ice and wind remain.\n\nFrom the top the North unrolls in white silence; to the south, the realm lies small and far.\n\nThe Lord Commander points to distant smoke beyond the treeline. “There,” he says, “is why we keep the watch.”"
 rk_nw.0006.a: "It is a wonder unlike any other."
